TODO:
- crafting system
    - crafting plan
    - linked BOM

Next TODO:
- better bot layer
     - waypoint system
        - replace existing navigation
        - can be used for all movement?
    - track stats
        - item inspection
        - item movement - kept, thrown out, etc
        - lava, water, etc
        - track any lava encountered
        - track # steps

Modules:
- inventory system
- building system
- mining system
    - split up mine-able volume into regions
    - track mining status of regions
    - keep regions small-ish?
        - 1/2 or 1/4 chunk horizontal
        - x vertical segments
            - just 3? high, med, deep - basically divides kinds of resources
            - 3-15 - deep - diamonds, redstone
            - 16-30 - gold, emerald, lapis
            - 31-60 - iron, coal
    - list of desired materials - based on goals - determine vertical range from it

- fuel farm
    - tree spacing
    - number of trees per row
    - number of rows of trees
    - number of levels
    - kinds of trees
    - smelting area
    - storage area
        - saplings
        - building materials
        - tree product
        - intermediate fuel
        - finished fuel

- processes:
    - location validation
    - fuel monitoring
    - sync @ core scheduling



Goal-Driven AI
- goal is to replicate
    - to replicate, certain needs must be met
    - materials -> activity -> farm, mining, etc
    - based on activity, certain infrastructure is needed
        - ex: to go mining deep, fuel is needed
        - ex: to get fuel of x, a farm of x size is needed
        - ex: mine of x size requires y storage
        - ex: storage needs of x -> central warehouse

- population or resource thresholds determine extras
    - min requirements before additional non-required builds can happen
    -

- determining plan...
    - next replication goal -> material needs
    - material needs -> activity needs (wood farm, mining)
    - activity needs ->



Tiers - not a distinct thing
    - drive goals from population + preferences

:Auto-Gen Tiers
- use seed + player input to control generation
- tier is an integer, starting at 1
- population requirement for tiers is tier*2
    - so to get into tier2, 2 turtles are needed
    - population counts? turtles only or computers too??
- turtle fuel requirement: tier*1000 + tier*2000 reserve
- location assignment
    - ranked in order of need - 10 is essential, 1 is never needed
    - player choice can affect this (?)
    - scores:
        - essentiality
        - player focus
        - -other-?
- material assignment
    - materials ranked on
        - looks
        - durability
- location layout
    - ask player about area to use?
    - ask player about coordinates
    - carve out for player (?)
        - do turtles build things in the carve out or is it left
          up to the player??
    - config for turtle infrastructure being subterranian?
    - map locations around - leaving ample space between
        - location re-mapping - starting out, the fuel farm and mine
            are probably one location, but should be split out later on
            with each having their own main location, storage, etc

Expeditions:
- turtles setup to be a team with some resources
- ask player to take them somewhere and...
    - chunkload the area
    - or the turtles should be armed with a few chunkloaders
- the expeditions are for resource gathering  (and fun)

Todo:
- Turtle
    - Tree Farm
    - Crafting
    - Land Shaping
    - Building
    - Waypoint system
    - Shipping

- Plans for:
    - fuel farm (tree farm + charcoal manufacturing)
    - mine
    - core
    - warehouse
    - fort
    - agriculture
        - wheat
        - barley
        - pumpkin
        - melon
        - other
    - player food farm
    - player store
    - player home
    - workshop (crafting area)
        - bot birthing area
    - Blacksmith
    - lake/aquarium
    - mob farm

- Locations
    - the function assigned to an area
- Structures
    - the buildings or installations that make an area able to perform
        its function

- First turtle becomes the overseer
    - main plan
    - tracks defined locations
    - decides population and jobs
    - transfer itself to a computer at some point?
        - write the current status and program to a computer
        - re-write its own startup file
        - reboot computer
        - verify computer is overseer
        - reboot self
        - turtle is now the 'main minion' of the computer

- Other turtles must report-in periodically (?)
    -> core
    -> disk drives? (pre-rednet)


- Overseer State Machine
    - on Entering a tier
        - plan out base design - goal
        - plan base update
